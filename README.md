# CogiSearch for Firefox & Chrome

This browser extension integrates CogiSearch as a search engine for Firefox and Chrome browsers, with several powerful features.

## What is CogiSearch?

CogiSearch is a search router that lets you:
- Use "bangs" (special prefixes like `!g`) to search directly on specific sites
- Customize your own bangs for your favorite websites 
- Set a preferred default search engine

## Key Features

### 1. Search Engine Integration
- Add CogiSearch to your browser's search engines list
- Set it as your default if desired
- Use the search bar directly with CogiSearch

### 2. Bang Synchronization
The extension automatically syncs your custom bangs across browsers via your browser account:
- Create a custom bang on one device, use it on another
- Works with Firefox Sync and Chrome sync
- Bangs sync between different browsers and platforms

### 3. Bang Management
- Create and manage custom bangs directly from the CogiSearch website
- Changes sync automatically across all your devices
- No separate accounts needed - uses your browser's built-in sync

## Installation

### Firefox

You can find the extension here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cogisearch/

### Chrome

## How Bang Synchronization Works

This extension synchronizes your custom bangs in the background:
1. When you create a bang on the CogiSearch website, it saves to your browser's sync storage
2. The extension automatically keeps your bangs in sync across all your devices
3. No separate account or login needed - just be signed into your browser

For example, create a custom bang `!dev` for DevDocs.io on your laptop, and it will be available on your desktop computer automatically.

## Privacy

CogiSearch takes your privacy seriously:
- We don't track your searches
- We don't collect personal data
- Custom bangs are stored only in your browser's sync storage
